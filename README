# 🎬 YouTube UI Clone

This is a **fully responsive YouTube UI clone** built using **React** and **Tailwind CSS**. The project mimics the layout and visual design of YouTube's frontend to sharpen UI/UX development skills and practice building scalable React components.

> ⚠️ This is a **frontend-only project** – it does not fetch real videos or connect to the actual YouTube API (yet).

## 🧠 Motivation

This project was built to:
- Practice responsive layout using Tailwind CSS
- Explore component-based architecture in React
- Understand how popular platforms structure their UI
- Prepare for frontend developer interviews and portfolio building
